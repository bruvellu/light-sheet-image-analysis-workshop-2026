Main repository for the Light-Sheet Image Analysis Workshop 2026 organized by LiSIUM from 5–9 January 2026 at the Center for Integrative Biology, Universidad Mayor, Huechuraba Campus, in Santiago, Chile.

- **Target Audience:** Scientists with access to light-sheet microscopy data who want to learn how to perform quantitative analysis in volumetric data. Knowing basic concepts of fluorescent microscopy and image analysis is ideal.
- **Format:** Mornings – Theory | Afternoons – Practical Workshops | Clinic with own or example data.
- **Goal:** Equip participants with fundamental and advanced tools for analyzing volumetric microscopy datasets. Students will work with their own data or provided datasets, culminating in short presentations.
