This will advance to the next frame showing you the first spot in white dashed line and the second spot in white solid line with a white solid link between the two.\n\n\n\nStill holding A, position the second spot, then release A to create the new linked spot\nCheck how the second spot and a link were created in the TrackScheme automatically\n\n\n\nContinue to track the nucleus for a few more frames, until the frame immediately before division\nNote that when you click on a spot in the bdv window, the corresponding spot is highlighted in the TrackScheme window\nSee what happens to the bdv when clicking the spots in TrackScheme… (nothing, unless it is the spot in view)\nLet’s change that\nIn the menu bar of bdv and TrackScheme windows there are locks 1, 2, 3. Click on lock 1 in both windows\n\n\n\nNow click through spots in the TrackScheme; the view in the bdv will change to show the selected spot at the center\n\n\n\nBefore we continue tracking the cell division, let’s check one of the amazing Mastodon features\nClick on the bdv button in the Mastodon project window and another bdv window will open\n\n\n\nNow activate lock 1 and click on one of the TrackScheme spots; both windows will be synchronized!\n\n\n\nWhy is this useful for manual tracking?\nAdjust the view to center the spot in the second bdv window, press Shift+Y, and select a spot from the TrackScheme. Now we have both XY and ZY views of the same nucleus!\n\n\n\nWhich is great for tracking in 3D. You can check, for instance, that your spot is well centered in Z and adjust it in this window\n\n\n\nContinue the tracking of one of the daughter cells. Select the last spot in the TrackScheme, go to the XY bdv, hover the mouse over the circle and hold A, move the spot, and release A to add it.\nDo it for a few frames\nThen go back to the pre-division spot and add a linked spot corresponding to the other daughter cell\nThis will create the first branch of the lineage tree\n\n\n\nContinue tracking the second daughter cell for a few frames\n\n\n\nIf you zoom out the TrackScheme view you will be able to see the full branched tree",

Behavior should remain as Add\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Preview and see how well the detection will work by exploring a new bdv window.\n\n\n\nDo you observe too many false positives? You can change the diameter, for example, and try the preview again to see what happens to the detected spots\nOnce satisfied, press Next and wait\n\n\n\nWhen the detection is done, press Finish\n\n\n\nThe bdv windows and the TrackScheme will be showing a lot of new spots.\nExplore the spots in the BigDataViewer and TrackScheme windows.

This is the main menu of BigStitcher. Anything that we select will only be applied to the selected views.\nAfter right-clicking, find the section Processing and select Detect Interest Points…\n\n\n\nIn this first window we can choose the type of detection (Default: Difference of Gaussian) and a label to describe these interest points\nOne dataset can have multiple sets of interest points\nWe will keep the default options and press OK\n\n\n\nWe can set different parameters for the Difference of Gaussian approach\nWhat is important to us at this point is to make sure that Interactive… is set for Interest point specification and that you change Downsample XY from Match Z Resolution (less downsampling) to 2x. The latter is not essential for all datasets but it works better for this dataset which has relatively high anisotropy (lower Z resolution compared to XY). Keep Downsample Z as 1x.\nPress OK\n\n\n\nIn case, we can select which view we will open the interactive window and if we will load the entire stack. Simply press OK to load the entire first view\n\n\n\nA stack will open with a rectangular ROI placed at the top left corner\nThe ROI shows a live view of detected points for the current parameters Sigma and Threshold present in the other window\n\n\n\nSigma is the size (radius) of the point and Threshold is the intensity-based cut value to discard low-quality detections\nThe default is to Find DoG maxima (red) or, in other words, bright spots. You can also find dark spots surrounded by bright areas (useful for some samples)\nThis is a normal ImageJ window, so you can zoom, adjust contrast, and if you lose the ROI you can simply draw a new rectangular ROI\nYou can drag the ROI around by clicking inside it and holding/dragging it\n\n\n\nWhat we want to do now is to adjust the Sigma and Threshold so that most of the beads outside the embryo are properly detect with the least of spurious detections\nThe best way to begin is to zoom in into a bead outside the embryo and check if the circle size is matching well the bead. Move the Sigma slider, aiming for a circle slightly larger than the bead\nRemember to also move through the Z slices of the stack to see how the detection behaves\nIf the size looks good, now increase the Threshold until real beads begin to not be detect. Once you reach this point roll the slider back until most beads are detected\nNote that, no matter how much you tweak these parameters, there’ll always be many detections in the sample tissues. These non-bead detections will not have a strong influence on the registration given that you have enough detected real beads\nOnce satisfied, press Done\n\n\n\nBead detection takes some time\nOnce DONE, go to the Multiview Explorer window and press Save\n\n\n\nThis is important because the detections are initially saved in memory and will be only written to disk after pressing Save (detections are saved in a directory named interestpoints.n5)\nYou can notice that the column #InterestPoints in the Multiview Explorer now shows 1 for the five views of channel 561 (but not for channel 488)",

Please refer to the BigStitcher documentation for the specific function of these\nFor us, it is important to note two. The option Fix views set to Fix first view means that all other views will be mapped to the first angle. And the Transformation model set to Affine means that the data will be transformed non-rigidly to fit the individual views. This is important since different portions of the stack might have a certain degree of distortion from the objective lenses and an affine transformation helps to fit the views better together\nThe other parameters we will only need to change if our registration fails\nPress OK\n\n\n\nThis small window with Regularization Parameters can be kept as is (Rigid and 0.10).

The best way to do this is visually\nOne of the first things that you can do is to press shift+y and zoom in into a bead close to the embryo’s surface\n\n\n\nYou will see the point spread function of one bead in each individual view forming a star with generally four views (as the fifth view is too further away).\nIf the sample is registered well, the center of the point spread functions of the different views should match in the middle of the star\n\n\n\nAnother thing that you can do is to find a structure you know well in the sample and check that the tissues are actually registered. It can happen that the beads are nicely registered, but the tissues themselves are a bit off\nOne way to do this is to select only two contiguous views and check them closely\nWhen done, make sure to Save the project again\n\n\n\nAfter saving, the #Registrations column should now show the number 3 for the selected views (if not deselect and select them again to update the counter)",

This reduces the final dimensions and file size of the fused data.\nFor that, right-click and select Define Bounding Box…\n\n\n\nWe want to define it interactively, so leave the Bounding Box option as isotropic\nYou can give the bounding box a custom name and define different bounding boxes for different purposes, but the default name is good enough for this tutorial. Click OK\n\n\n\nTwo windows will open: BigDataViewer with the sample and some purple shade and a bounding box window full of sliders\n\n\n\nFor defining the bounding box I follow a specific procedure, always in the same order, to avoid inadvertently leaving out a part of your sample when fusing\nFirst, press shift+x to orient the sample on XY\n\n\n\nGo through the sample (Z) top to bottom to get a sense of the entire volume and stop back at the middle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove the x min slider to the right to cut out the region on the left of the sample (the dashed line is the reference edge).

I highly recommend downsampling 2x, 4x, or even 8x, depending on the dataset, if you are fusing a dataset for the first time.\nFusing without downsampling (1x) can take a really long time for large samples (many hours), so it is good practice to downsample the fused image to make sure the fusing parameters are good for your dataset before fusing the whole thing.\nBut for this tutorial, you can leave at 1x\nFor Interpolation leave Linear interpolation as it gives better outputs\nFusion type is an important parameter to choose wisely\nThe simplest is Avg, which averages the signal of every view per pixel. This is quick but it is combining the good contrast of one view with the blurred side of another view and the resulting contrast will be suboptimal.\nAvg, Blending is the same as Avg, but it blends smoothly the edges of the different views giving a slightly better fusing than simple Avg\nAvg, Blending & Content Based improves the other two options by adding a step that checks and keeps only the best information for each coordinate (keep good contrast, discard blurred information). This option gives the best results. However, it is also the one that requires more memory and takes longer to finish (much longer)\nTherefore, I would start with 2x or 4x downsample using Avg, Blending before trying less downsampling and the content based fusion\nFor the Pixel type I often use 16-bit, but it depends on what is your goal with the fused image. If it is only to have a volume visualization, 8-bit might be enough. If further processing and analysis is expected, definitely go for 16-bit or, in special cases, 32-bit.\nBigStitcher also has an option for using the interest points information during the fusion step to obtain better results (Non-Rigid fusion). This is for advanced users and I have not tried it enough to have an opinion about it.\nGenerally, we want to have one fused image per timepoint per channel\nAnd I always Save as (compressed) TIFF stacks for the Fused image option. Choosing Display using ImageJ can be dangerous as the fused image will be large and your computer can run out of memory and crash. Writing to disk is safer.\nAfter pressing OK there’ll be another window to define the min/max levels, but they are automatically detected. Press OK\n\n\n\nThe output directory will be the same where the dataset.xml is. You can add a Filename addition to distinguish different types of fusion and downsampling (useful when doing it multiple times)\nPress OK and fusion will start\n\n\n\nOnce done, drag and drop the fused dataset named avg_blend_1x_fused_tp_0_ch_1 in Fiji to open it and adjust the contrast with the Brightness/Contrast tool to see the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspect the fusion result, checking for artifacts. If your sample has a membrane staining, for example, check for doubled membranes\nNote that this is an isotropic dataset",

Generally, Replace all transformations work for most cases. However, I often prefer to use Add last transformation only. This will take the last transformation from the source channel and apply to the target channel.\nNote, however, that for this to work, the source channel can only be one transformation ahead of the target. If for instance, we ran two subsequent transformations for the source channel, then applying only the last would not duplicate all the transformations. Always check the #Registrations in the Multiview Explorer.\n\n\n\nOnce you press OK, the transformations will be applied in the XML file. It’s quick.\nNow open BigStitcher again and check if the 5 views of the other channel are registered (they should)",

    "text": "Segment tissues in ilastik\n\nThe first step we need is to segment the stack in 3D to distinguish what is tissue and what is background\nThis is required to create a 3D mesh in Blender that has the shape of the sample\nTo accomplish that, we will use ilastik\nOpen the directory ilastik-1.4.1.post1-Linux, right-click the file run_ilastik.sh, and select Run as a Program to open ilastik\n\n\n\nCreate project\n\nMaximize the interface (we will need it)\nUnder Create New Project, click on Pixel Classification\n\n\n\nThe window Create Ilastik Project will open\nNavigate to your working directory and click save\nA file named MyProject.ilp will be created\n\n\n\n\nInput Data\n\nThe ilastik interface is ready to define our input data\nUnder the Raw Data tab, click on Add New... &gt; Add separate Image(s)...\n\n\n\nThen select the file Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry.tif\n\n\n\nilastik will open the dataset in three orthogonal views\nXY (blue), XZ (green), YZ (red)\n\n\n\nNote, however, that the images are too dark; let’s fix this\nRight-click the dataset row and select Edit properties...\nChange the value of Normalize Display to True and set the Range maximum value to 10000\nPress OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contrast will be much better now\n\n\n\n\nFeature Selection\n\nNext we need to select the image features to take into account for the segmentation\nOn the left column press 2. Feature Selection; the interface will update\nThen press Select Features... to open the Features window\nSelect all the features and press OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nOn the left column, click 3. Training\nA new toolbox will open underneath showing two labels, Label 1 (yellow) and Label 2 (blue), buttons for paint or eraser modes, a size drop-down menu, and a Live Update button\n\n\n\nNow is a good time to get familiar with the basic ilastik commands\nscroll+forward: go down through the slices of the orthogonal dimension\nscroll+backward: go up through the slices of the orthogonal dimension\nctrl+scroll+forward: zoom in\nctrl+scroll+backward: zoom out\nmiddle-click+hold: drag view around\nLearn how to zoom in/out, go through the slices, and drag the view\nIf you can zoom in significantly, and reach the top or bottom of a view by dragging, you are ready for painting\n\n\n\nOur goal is to paint tissues in yellow and background in blue\nBut to accomplish that, we only need a few strokes at the right regions of the image\nBegin by zooming in at the top region of the XZ (green) view\nSelect Label 2 (blue), change the size to 7, and paint a line right above the tissue\nNow select Label 1 (yellow) and paint the tissue immediately below the blue line\nThese two simple lines are indicating to ilastik that all the image features in this region very close to the tissue corresponds to “background”, and that the image features of the tissue below correspond to “foreground”. Putting the two linnes adjacent to each other also help ilastik to understand where the boundaries are\n\n\n\nSince we want that all of the tissue is segmented (and not just the surface), paint a line until the center of the embryo\nThis is enough to get started. Based on these simple strokes, ilastik will learn and apply this to the entire dataset\nTo start the training, press the button Live Update\nilastik will overlay the current segmentation model over the image\nYou should see that most of the tissue regions are yellow and that the region around the embryo are more blue\nThe more vivid the color, the more confident the model is about that specific region\n\n\n\nNow start painting with simple strokes areas which are wrong or pale\nFor example the corners of the images are background and should be blue; any area inside the sample, should be yellow; use different brush sizes if needed; or the eraser\nThis sample also has giant, super bright beads; they are not tissue, we want them blue\nNote that the segmentation model and overlay colors update upon each stroke, so you can see if what you did improved or worsen the segmentation. If it got worse, you can always erase the annotation\n\n\n\nBe meticulous and pay special attention to the edges of the image, we do not want tissue (yellow) to be touching the border, because this will create a hole in the segmentation\nThe better the segmentation is, the better will be our visualization and cartographic projection\nThat said, there are many ways that you can fix issues and improve the segmentation after converting it to a mesh\nIn this image, it is important to take care of the tip of the very top part of the sample because it is touching the edge\nUse a size 1 brush to place a couple of blue lines there\n\n\n\nGo through the slices in each of the orthogonal views to fix any left over segmentation uncertainties\nThe segmentation overlay should be showing a clearly separated yellow and blue regions that match the embryo and background\n\n\n\n\nPrediction Export\n\nWe can now export the segmentation prediction\nOn the left column, click on 4. Prediction Export\nUnder Export Settings keep the Source value as Probabilities\n\n\n\nThen press Choose Export Image Settings... to open the Image Export Options window\nThere are two options that we need to change\nUnder Cutout Subregion uncheck the row c (for channels) and change the stop value to 1\nSince this image has only one channel, changing this option avoids loading a duplicated channel into Blender\nUnder Output File Info change the value of Format to multipage tiff\nThis is required to be able to load the segmentation into Blender\nPress OK close the window\nThen press the Export All button and wait…\n\n\n\nWhen the prediction is done, you will find a new file in your working directory named Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry_Probabilities.tiff\n\n\n\nTry opening this file in Fiji to see how it looks before our next step in the tutorial\n\n\n\nNow close the file and let’s start with the actual projection",

    "text": "Import data to Blender\n\nWe can now import the image stack and segmentation probabilities into Blender\n\n\nOpen Blender\n\nEnter the directory blender-4.2.9-linux-x64 and double-click the file blender\n\n\n\nBlender will open with a nice splash screen at the center, click anywhere to close it\n\n\n\nNotice at the top left region that we are in the Layout tab (important for later)\nYou’ll see a gray cube at the center, we want to get rid of it\nIn the top right panel under Scene Collection &gt; Collection, right-click the Cube line and select Delete\n\n\n\nGreat. Let’s focus now at the bottom right corner, it is busy, full of icons and menus. Don’t get overwhelmed, we only need to select and use one of the modes\nIf not yet selected, click on the Scene icon (it is the white triangle with two circles) to activate this panel\nThen locate the tab named Tissue Cartography at the bottom\n\n\n\nScroll down and make the side panels wider to be able to read the options of Tissue Cartography\nThis is the main interface of the Blender Tissue Cartography add-on\nIt is through here that we will control most of the steps of this pipeline\n\n\n\n\nLoad sample\n\nThe first thing we need to do is to load the sample\nClick on the folder icon in the Tissue Cartography &gt; File Path, navigate to your working directory, and select the file Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry.tiff\nTip: bookmark the directory for easy access in the future\nClick Accept\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen press Load .tiff file to load it into Blender\nA new row will appear at the top right panel under Scene Collection &gt; Collection named Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry_BoundingBox and the bounding box of the image stack will be visible in the main window as orange lines\n\n\n\nOnly a portion of the bounding box is visible, but we want to see the whole thing\nThe controls to navigate the 3D space are at the top right corner of the main window\nYou have XYZ handles (red, green, blue), a zoom tool (magnifier lens), and a move tool (open hand)\nClick, hold, and drag any of these to move around\nClicking on the X, Y, or Z will reorient your sample along these axes (very useful)\nTake some time to practice and finish by placing the bounding box at the center of the main window as in the image below\n\n\n\n\nLoad probabilities\n\nNow let’s load the probabilities files\nClick in the folder icon of the Tissue Cartography &gt; Segmentation File Path, navigate to your working directory, and select the file Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry_Probabilities.tiff\nClick Accept\n\n\n\nThe file name will appear in the field, but before loading we want to adjust one parameter\nBlender will take the segmentation probabilities and convert it into a tridimensional mesh\nGenerally, the raw segmentation is full of sharp angles, which will not look very nice when we map the image information onto the mesh for visualization\nTherefore, it is generally a good idea to apply a degree of smoothing upon importing the segmentation\nYou can control the smoothing in the small field below and to the right of Segmentation File Path named S... 0.00. It should read Smoothing (µm) but the panel is too narrow to show the full name\nClick on it and set it to 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow click on Get mesh(es) from binary segmentation .tiff file(s) to generate the mesh\nIt takes a second\nA gray mesh shaped like our sample will appear inside the bounding box in the main window\nAlso notice that a new row appeared at the top right panel under Scene Collection &gt; Collection named Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry_Probabilities_c0\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully generated a 3D mesh of your sample. That’s already a powerful visualization method\nCelebrate by exploring your sample. Rotate all around, zoom in to see details, and check how good the mesh is. Are there any holes or other artifacts?\n\n\n\nApply shading\n\nThe mesh is nice, but it would even better to see the actual image data overlaid on the mesh\nWe can accomplish that using the shading view and function of Blender\nFirst we need to activate the shading viewport at the top right corner of the main window, an icon that looks like a pie chart\n\n\n\nOnce clicked, the mesh will become almost white\n\n\n\nBefore applying the shading, there’s one important parameter to set: Vertex ... 0.00 or, in full, Vertex Shader Normal Offset (µm)\n\n\n\nWhen this parameter is 0, the image data that corresponds to the limits of the segmentation is applied onto the mesh. In this case, this is the surface of the sample which, in this case, does not have much information. The fluorescent signal of the tissue, in this case, is a few microns deeper. Therefore, we can use the offset parameter to adjust the exact layer to be applied to the mesh as shading\nIn this case, a value of 5 works well\n\n\n\nNow, every time we want to apply or refresh the shading, we need to select the bounding box and probabilities entries in the Scene Collection &gt; Collection top right panel\nYou can do so by clicking on one and ctrl+clicking on the other\n\n\n\nFinally, to apply the shading press Initialize/refresh vertex shading and wait\nAfter a few seconds, you should see cell membranes overlaid onto the mesh\n\n\n\nTake the chance to explore the sample again, now with some biological information projected into 3D!",

Simply press A or click on Select &gt; All\n\n\n\nTo finish the setup, click on the Y axis handles until the sample is oriented vertically with the pointy side upward\n\n\n\nWe are now ready to project the mesh\n\n\n\nProject mesh\n\nWhile the right side shows your sample, the left side shows how the projected mesh looks like; it is initially empty\nTo make the first projection, go to UV &gt; Cylinder Projection to project the mesh over the curved wall of a cylinder\n\n\n\nA crazy, palisade wall will appear\nDon’t despair and click on the tiny menu named Cylinder Projection that appeared at the bottom of the workspace\n\n\n\nThe options for the cylinder projection will appear\nThere you can define the orientation of the axes and other options to change how the 3D mesh is transformed into a 2D surface\nWhat we need for now is to activate the checkbox Scale to Bounds\nThis will nicely contain the projection into the squared bounding area\n\n\n\nAnd… that’s it. We have our first projected mesh\nHow good is it? Ideally, the mesh should occupy the entire area\nOur projected mesh has a couple of portions slightly bulging outside the area, and we have an empty vertical portion on the right side\nThis could be fixed with some editing\nHowever, for now, it looks good enough for a first try\n\n\n\nProject data\n\nWe need to project the actual image data onto this surface\nChange back to the Layout workspace, select both Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry_BoundingBox and Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry_Probabilities_c0 under Scene Collection &gt; Collection, and change the option Normal Offs... (Normal Offsets (µm)) to 5 to match the Vertex Shader Normal Offset (µm) options\nNote: that Normal Offsets (µm) accepts a comma-separated lists of values. We can put 0,1,2,3,4,5 to generate a projection with 6 slices representing onion layers deeper into the tissues\nThe click on Create Projection\n\n\n\nWait… the interface might become unresponsive. If a dialog appears, click on Wait\nWhen done, the shading over the sample will blink. It should look very similar to how it was before (if it doesn’t, it is a sign that something went wrong)\n\n\n\nCheck projection\n\nTo visually inspect the projected data we need to change back to the UV Editing workspace\n\n\n\nZoom out on the left side window to see the entire projection\nThen click anywhere outside the sample or projection to unselect the mesh\nThe sample mesh will become visible in black, and the cartographic projection should appear on the left side window\nThe orientation of the sample will match that of the sample (if the sample is upside down when you project the mesh, the projected mesh will also be upside down)\n\n\n\nSo what happened here? We projected the sample mesh to 2D using the cylinder approach. Then the add-on Blender Tissue Cartography used this projected mesh to create a projection of the image data from the original stack. Quite nice!\nEvery time you create a new projection, the projected data is stored as an image which is available for Blender to display as an image data-block\nYou can see them by clicking on the picture icon in the top menu\nThis first projection is named Channel_0_Layer_0. The next will be named Channel_0_Layer_0.001, Channel_0_Layer_0.002, and so on\n\n\n\n\nSave projection\n\nThe projection now exists in Blender, but we need to export it to file\nFor that, go back to the Layout workspace, select both Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry_BoundingBox and Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry_Probabilities_c0 under Scene Collection &gt; Collection again, then click on Save Projection\n\n\n\nA Blender File View window will open\nNavigate to your working directory\nIn the file name field put the name of the file with _cylinder appended to it, to read Drosophila_CAAX-mCherry_cylinder.tif\nThen press Save Projection\nThree new files will appear on your working directory with BakedData, BakedNormals, and BakedPositions suffixes appended to the dataset filename\n\n\n\nBakedData shows the original image data projected on the surface\nBakedPositions shows the original XYZ positions projected on the surface in RGB\nBakedNormals shows the XYZ surface directions perpendicular to each point in RGB\n\n\n\nOpen projection\n\nLet’s open the files in Fiji for inspection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore them in more detail, check with Image &gt; Color &gt; Channels Tool...

    "section": "Optimize projection",
    "text": "Optimize projection\n\nOur initial projection is satisfactory, but there are many ways to optimize it to your specific needs\nOne immediate thing is to try a Sphere Projection instead of Cylinder Projection. They are quite similar, but I found the sphere projection to be more consistent and predictable and might work better for more spherical samples\nBut another common use case is to be able to determine where the mesh will unwrap. This might be important for downstream analyses\nIn our sample, for example, the projection put the dorsal side on the left side (where a clump of germ cells are visible at the bottom) and the ventral side on the right side. However, let’s say that I need for my analyses the dorsal side at the center of the projection\nTo accomplish that we can manually mark a seam on our mesh to define the unwrapping position\n\n\nMark seam on mesh\n\nGo to the UV Editing workspace and change the Select Mode to Edge select\n\n\n\nIn this mode, when you click on the mesh an edge is selected and when you subsequently ctrl+click on another edge, the shortest path between the two edges will be selected. Like this you can quickly select a line along your sample to mark the unwrapping position\nWhat we want is to trace a line through the ventral side of the sample. This is the region opposite to the germ cell clump\nUsing the handle buttons, reorient the sample sideways with the ventral side facing you\n\n\n\nWe need to start by selecting an edge at one of the poles\nTurn the sample to show one of the poles and zoom in to see the edges clearly\nThen click on one at the center of the pole to select it\n\n\n\nZoom out slightly, turn the sample, and ctrl+click on another edge further from the pole\nA yellow line will appear connecting the pole with the current edge\n\n\n\nContinue ctrl+clicking edges along the sample until the opposite pole\nDon’t worry if the line is not perfectly straight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow press ctrl+e to open a menu with edge options and select Mark Seam\n\n\n\nThe seam will be marked in red (below it’s mixed with yellow line from the edge selection)\n\n\n\n\nProject mesh with seam\n\nNow reorient the sample vertically again with the narrow tip up and change the Select Mode back to Face select\n\n\n\nPress A to select all the mesh (they will turn orange)\nGo to UV &gt; Cylinder Projection\nThen check Preserve Seams in the option box\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the projection changed\nIt is squeezed at the center of the projection area due to the very long protruding mesh at the top left and bottom right regions\nLet’s evaluate how good it is by projecting the data\n\n\n\nProject data with seam\n\nGo to the Layout workspace, select both the bounding box and probabilities under Scene Collection, and press Create Projection; then, wait…\n\n\n\nWhen done, go back to the UV Editing workspace and click anywhere outside the sample to unselect the mesh\nThe new data projection should be visible on the left side\nIf not, click on the image data-block picture icon and select Channel_0_Layer_0.001\n\n\n\nWe have successfully changed the position of the unwrapping using the seam\nThe clump of germ cells is now at the center of the projection\nThis projection is OK, but the contents are squeezed and it is not occupying the full area\nWe can improve this by editing the projection mesh\n\n\n\nEdit projected mesh\n\nPress A to select the entire mesh\nSelect the tool Transform on the left side menu\n\n\n\nHover the mouse on the right side edge to reveal the scale handle\n\n\n\nDrag it to the right to extend the mesh until the edge of the projection area\nThen drag the other size and make the final scaling adjustments so that the projected mesh is covering most of the projection area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can use the Pinch or Grab tools to edit the mesh at the corners, so that they are not clipped out (you can also leave them as is, they will not appear in the projected data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck edited projection\n\nTo check the new projection with the edited mesh, we need to re-create the data projection\nGo to the Layout workspace, select both the bounding box and probabilities under Scene Collection, and press Create Projection; then, wait…\nWhen done, switch to the UV Editing workspace and deselect the mesh and check the new projection (select the latest image data-block, likely Channel_0_Layer_0.002)\nDespite the unevenness of the corners (next time we can do better), this edited projection is better than the first one\n\n\n\nLet’s save the projection to disk by going to the Layout workspace, selecting both the bounding box and probabilities entries under Scene Collection &gt; Collection, and clicking on Save Projection\nThen navigate to your working directory and give the file a different suffix\n\n\n\nFinally, open the newly generated files in Fiji to investigate",

We will create a labels layer to anotate some ground truth for our object classifier.\nIn the left pannel, select the brush tool and make some background anotations with the brush. Then change to label 2 and make some object annotations (cells).\n\n\n\nDraw the labels\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to\nTools → Segmentation / labeling → Object segmentation (APOC)\n\n\n\nBrightness/Contrast histogram\n\n\nSelect the raw data for training and the labels layer for ground truth. Then click Train. Observe the results in 3D. For better visualization you can hide the labels layer.\n\n\n\nTrain\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve labels result\n\n\nFrom this first round of training, very likely the result is not perfect. This is because our ground truth anotation was done on a single z slice, so the classifier will perform well only around that depth. We can do several rounds of training.\nSelect again the labels image, and in the 2D mode go to a different z. Perform new anotations, preserving the label orders for background and object. Then just click Train again and observe the new results. Repeat as needed. Note that a classifier file will be produced and overwritten after each training. This can be used for batch segmentation of data from the same experiment/microscope.\n\n\n\nModify labels layer\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-train\n\n\n\n\n\nNow there might be some small objects that we want to filter. Go to\nTools → Segmentation post-processing → Exclude small labels\nThen select the layer Result of ObjectSegmentation and impose a minimum size of 20 (it will say maximum size in napari, but it is a mistake from the developers). Run it and observe the final labels (hide the old labels for better visualization.\n\n\n\nExclude small objects\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve filtered labels\n\n\nNow that we have a nice set of labels in 3D, we will quantify intensity and morphology based parameters for further analysis.\nGo to\nTools → Measurement tables → Regionprops\nSelect all parameters except moments and click run.\n\n\n\nRegionprops\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\nWe can export this table or visualize some of the data using the cluster plotter.\n\n\n\nGo to\nPlugins → napari-clusters-plotter → Plotter widget\nIn here you can select any measurement (column) from the region props table and make scatter plots.\n\n\n\nPlotter widget\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter plot\n\n\nA very useful tool is that we can draw in the plot closed curves and the objects falling inside will be automatically colorcoded and visualized in the 3D rendered image. I recommend hiding all the other layers except the raw image.\nBy pressing shift, we can draw further subgroups.\n\n\n\nLabel IDs\n\n\n\nThis manual selection generates a new column in the regionprops table with the identifier for us to export and further analyse in other software.\n\n\n\nGo to\nPlugins → napari-clusters-plotter → Dimensionality Reduction Widget\nThis is a very useful tool in which we can apply a variety of dimensionality reduction methods to our list of parameters. In this example I used UMAPS. We can select how many components we want and after hitting run they will be added to our regionprops table.\n\n\n\nDimensionality Reduction\n\n\n\n\n\nUMAP\n\n\nAfter doing this, we can come back to the Plotter Widget and plot this two components of the UMAP and generate more complex clustering of the data manually.\n\n\n\nUMAP viz\n\n\n\n\n\nManual Cluster ID\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what if we don’t want to be biased when clustering the data in subgroups? We can use unsupervised methods includded in this plugin. Go to\nPlugins → napari-clusters-plotter → Clustering Widget\nSelect the K-MEANS method, impose 3 clusters and run. This will generate a new column with the cluster ID for each object.\n\n\n\nClustering methods\n\n\n\n\n\nK-MEANS\n\n\nNow going back to the Plotter Widget, we can select the UMAP axis AND the K-MEAN cluster IDs to automatically colorcode the objects belonging to different classes.\n\n\n\nAutomatic clustering",
