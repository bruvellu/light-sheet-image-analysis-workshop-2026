This will advance to the next frame showing you the first spot in white dashed line and the second spot in white solid line with a white solid link between the two.\n\n\n\nStill holding A, position the second spot, then release A to create the new linked spot\nCheck how the second spot and a link were created in the TrackScheme automatically\n\n\n\nContinue to track the nucleus for a few more frames, until the frame immediately before division\nNote that when you click on a spot in the bdv window, the corresponding spot is highlighted in the TrackScheme window\nSee what happens to the bdv when clicking the spots in TrackScheme… (nothing, unless it is the spot in view)\nLet’s change that\nIn the menu bar of bdv and TrackScheme windows there are locks 1, 2, 3. Click on lock 1 in both windows\n\n\n\nNow click through spots in the TrackScheme; the view in the bdv will change to show the selected spot at the center\n\n\n\nBefore we continue tracking the cell division, let’s check one of the amazing Mastodon features\nClick on the bdv button in the Mastodon project window and another bdv window will open\n\n\n\nNow activate lock 1 and click on one of the TrackScheme spots; both windows will be synchronized!\n\n\n\nWhy is this useful for manual tracking?\nAdjust the view to center the spot in the second bdv window, press Shift+Y, and select a spot from the TrackScheme. Now we have both XY and ZY views of the same nucleus!\n\n\n\nWhich is great for tracking in 3D. You can check, for instance, that your spot is well centered in Z and adjust it in this window\n\n\n\nContinue the tracking of one of the daughter cells. Select the last spot in the TrackScheme, go to the XY bdv, hover the mouse over the circle and hold A, move the spot, and release A to add it.\nDo it for a few frames\nThen go back to the pre-division spot and add a linked spot corresponding to the other daughter cell\nThis will create the first branch of the lineage tree\n\n\n\nContinue tracking the second daughter cell for a few frames\n\n\n\nIf you zoom out the TrackScheme view you will be able to see the full branched tree",

    "text": "Automated Tracking\n\nThe final part of this tutorial is to try automatic detection and linking of spots\nThis is the dream: loading your data and getting out your lineage. However, in practice, it’s a lot messier. Cleaning, fixing, and curating the data is required to get a nice informative lineage\nWe will use a simplified version of the protocol included in this dataset in the file Protocol_Auto-Detection_Auto-Linking.docx\n\n\n\nDetection\n\nIn the Mastodon window, go to Plugins &gt; Tracking &gt; Detection...\n\n\n\nPress Next twice (leave options as is)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Advanced DoG detector and press Next\nKeep Detect: bright blobs, change Estimated diameter to 35px and Quality threshold to 100. Behavior should remain as Add\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Preview and see how well the detection will work by exploring a new bdv window.\n\n\n\nDo you observe too many false positives? You can change the diameter, for example, and try the preview again to see what happens to the detected spots\nOnce satisfied, press Next and wait\n\n\n\nWhen the detection is done, press Finish\n\n\n\nThe bdv windows and the TrackScheme will be showing a lot of new spots.\nExplore the spots in the BigDataViewer and TrackScheme windows. If you zoom in a lot you’ll see the unlinked, individual spots per frame\n\n\n\n\nCleaning\n\nBefore we try to automatically link these spots, let’s remove low quality detections\nOn the Mastodon window click on Table, resize it to have more space, and resize the column Detection q... to show Detection quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Detection quality to sort the table\n\n\n\nClick on the first row to select it. Select all rows where Detection quality is &lt;400\nThen click Edit &gt; Delete Selection\n\n\n\nClose the table\nYou can also manually delete obviously wrong spots by hovering and pressing D. Clean up the ones outside the embryo\n\n\n\nLinking\n\nNow let’s try linking\nIn the main Mastodon window click on Plugins &gt; Tracking &gt; Linking...\nKeep All spots selected for all timepoints (0-29) and press Next\nChoose Lap linker and click Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the parameters to:\n\nFrame to frame linking: Max distance to 40px\nGap closing: Max distance to 60px (keep others as is)\nTrack division: Check Allow track division, set Max distance to 40px, and press + to add a Feature penalty and set it to Center ch1 to 0.3\n\nPress Next to start linking and wait… then press Finish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that there are now tracks in the bdv and TrackScheme windows. Explore them a bit\n\n\n\nMastodon can calculate features (position, displacement, velocity, etc.) of individual spots, links and branches. Let’s do that\nIn the main Mastodon window press compute features. A Feature calculation window will open\n\n\n\nPress compute and wait… when it’s done, close it.\nNote that now the tracks in the BigDataViewer is showing colored links\n\n\n\nOpen the table window from the main window\nIt’ll be filled with computed features",

Then also click on autoscale\nClick Apply (nothing will happen) then OK\n\n\n\nOn the bdv window press View &gt; Coloring &gt; Velocity\n\n\n\nThe spots and links in the BigDataViewer window will change colors\n\n\n\nDo the same for the other bdv window and the TrackScheme\n\n\n\nThis gives a visual representation of cells which have a high displacement per frame. These might be artifacts in linking unrelated spots or, in a good processed lineage, reveal some biological process like cell migration",
